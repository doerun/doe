# Contracts Index

This directory contains contract drafts for the Chromium WebGPU lane.

These files define candidate module boundaries and promotion expectations before implementation.

Archived Track B module filenames retain their historical `fawn-*` identifiers
because the archived schemas and fixtures still use those ids.

## Files

     rules.
11. `browser-gpu-flight-recorder.contract.md`
   - Page-level GPU capture artifact contract for shaders, IR, backend output,
     command graphs, frame hashes, timings, and typed failures.
12. `browser-canvas-webgpu-fusion.contract.md`

14. `browser-gpu-scheduler.contract.md`

     effects, local AI, and compositor-adjacent work.
15. `browser-webgpu-effect-experiment.contract.md`
   - WebGPU-backed browser visual effect experiment contract that keeps
     layout, accessibility, and security semantics browser-owned.
16. `browser-local-ai-workloads.contract.md`
   - Browser local AI workload and receipt contract for embeddings, ranking,
     image/video transforms, and model inference.
17. `browser-pipeline-cache-receipts.contract.md`
   - Developer-visible cache hit/miss and pipeline creation receipt contract.

   - Developer-visible unsupported-capability and fallback explanation
     contract.
19. `browser-media-path-probe.contract.md`
   - External texture, external image copy, and shared texture/import probe
     contract.
20. `browser-recovery-parity.contract.md`
   - Dawn-vs-Doe crash, hang, device-loss, validation-error, and recovery
     parity contract.
21. `browser-cts-subset.contract.md`
   - Browser CTS subset contract for paired Dawn and forced-Doe evidence.
22. `../bench/workflows/browser-milestones.json`
   - schema-backed M0-M6 status manifest for current nursery state and local evidence.

## Contract Rules

1. Every contract must define:
   - input shape,
   - output artifacts,
   - failure taxonomy,
   - fallback policy,
   - gate coverage,
   - promotion criteria.
2. Any runtime-visible field promoted from these drafts must gain:
   - schema entries under `config/*schema*.json`,
   - status/process updates when behavior changes.
3. No draft in this directory may silently alter core runtime behavior.

## Draft Status

All contracts here are `draft` and non-binding until promoted through Doe stage and gate policy.
