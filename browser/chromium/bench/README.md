# Browser Benchmark Superset (Nursery)

This module implements a layered browser benchmark superset for Chromium Track A (browser).

## Layers

1. `L0 engine`
   - core strict runtime benchmark (`bench/workloads/specialized/workloads.amd.vulkan.superset.json`).
2. `L1 browser-api`
   - Playwright-driven browser WebGPU projections derived from `L0`.
3. `L2 browser-workflow`
   - browser end-to-end workflows that include WebGPU and browser lifecycle overhead.

## No-Maintenance Rule

1. Do not hand-maintain workload lists in nursery.
2. Generate projection manifest from core workloads using:
   - `scripts/generate-browser-projection-manifest.py`
3. Use `bench/projection-rules.json` for classification and scenario-template mapping.

## Files

1. `projection-rules.json`
   - domain -> projection-class/scenario-template mapping plus required-status and claim-scope.
2. `projection-manifest.schema.json`
   - schema for generated projection manifest.
3. `generated/browser_projection_manifest.json`
   - generated `L1/L0` projection rows with contract hashes and repo-relative source/rules paths.
4. `workflows/browser-workflow-manifest.json`
   - `L2` workflow definitions with required status, claim scope, and promotion approver roles.
5. `workflows/browser-workflow-manifest.schema.json`
   - schema for `L2` workflow manifest.
6. `workflows/browser-promotion-approvals.json`
   - explicit promotion approvals for the roles required by the workflow manifest.
7. `workflows/browser-promotion-approvals.schema.json`
   - schema for promotion approval artifact.
8. `workflows/browser-milestones.json`
   - source-of-truth milestone state for M0-M6.
9. `workflows/browser-milestones.schema.json`
   - schema for milestone tracking.

## Scripts

1. `scripts/generate-browser-projection-manifest.py`
   - emits generated manifest from core workload source.
2. `scripts/webgpu-playwright-layered-bench.mjs`
   - runs `L1` and `L2` browser benchmark layers for dawn/doe.
3. `scripts/webgpu-playwright-ort-bench.mjs`
   - runs a repo-only same-stack browser ORT WebGPU Dawn-vs-Doe benchmark
     against the local Chromium-vendored DistilBERT sentiment model.
   - currently supports `--task sentiment`, `--task sentiment_medium`, and
     `--task sentiment_longform`.
4. `../../bench/native-compare/compare.config.browser.ort-webgpu.json`
   - canonical `bench/` compare config for the same browser ORT tasks.
5. `scripts/check-browser-benchmark-superset.py`
   - validates projection completeness/hash sync, optional report coverage, and optional promotion approvals.
6. `scripts/run-browser-benchmark-superset.py`
   - one-command orchestration (generate -> run -> check -> summary + checker artifact).
7. `scripts/score-browser-layered-report.py`
   - emits a diagnostic score sidecar from a layered dawn/doe report:
     row-weighted score, category-balanced score, per-category scores,
     included rows, and excluded rows.
8. `scripts/run-consumer-bench.sh`
   - macOS/local side-by-side wrapper that compares stock Chrome as the Dawn
     baseline against the host Fawn Chromium build with Doe forced on.
9. `scripts/run-fawn-runtime-bench.sh`
   - macOS/local wrapper that keeps the same host Fawn Chromium binary on both
     sides and compares its Dawn runtime path against its forced Doe runtime
     path.
10. `scripts/check-browser-milestones.py`
   - validates milestone state and required local evidence for M0-M6.

## Quick Start

From `` root:

```bash
npm --prefix browser/chromium ci
./browser/chromium/scripts/run-bench.sh
```

To run dawn/doe against different browser executables in one benchmark run:

```bash
./browser/chromium/scripts/run-bench.sh \
  --mode both \
  --dawn-chrome /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome \
  --doe-chrome /path/to/your/doe-chromium-binary
```

On a macOS host with stock Chrome and a local Fawn source build, run the
consumer-facing diagnostic wrapper:

```bash
./browser/chromium/scripts/run-consumer-bench.sh --headless true --strict-run
```

To isolate the runtime swap inside the same local Fawn binary:

```bash
./browser/chromium/scripts/run-fawn-runtime-bench.sh --headless true --strict-run
```

The wrapper writes the same layered diagnostic artifacts plus:

- `browser/chromium/artifacts/<timestamp>/chrome-vs-fawn.browser-layered.superset.score.json`

The CLI prints separate paired scores for the baseline and comparison modes,
plus the comparison percent delta. `overall` is row-weighted.
`categoryBalancedOverall` uses the geometric mean of per-category geomeans so a
dense category cannot dominate the headline view. The legacy relative index is
still present in JSON as `score` for compatibility, but it is not the primary
readout. `bottlenecks` lists the slowest categories, rows, and measured phases
so regressions do not require manual row sorting. The score is directional
diagnostic evidence, not a release performance claim. The score sidecar carries
source report, workload, browser executable, runtime, shader compiler, adapter,
and trace-hash identity anchors and is covered by the browser artifact identity
coverage gate.

The L2 workflow manifest includes optional `fawn_visual_resource` rows for the
checked-in Fawn HTML pages under `browser/chromium/resources/`. Those rows load
the visible pages through the same local Playwright server and score shared
frame-time telemetry only when both Dawn and forced Doe emit it. Reports and
score rows carry the checked-in HTML resource path and SHA-256 so visual rows
stay tied to the exact page source that ran.

Layered runs request the high-performance WebGPU adapter by default on both
browser modes. Override with `--power-preference default` or
`--power-preference low-power` only when the artifact is meant to describe that
adapter policy; the raw report records the selected adapter request policy.

Texture L1 rows emit `textureMs` in addition to total `elapsedMs`. The score
sidecar prefers `textureMs` so adapter/device startup remains visible evidence
without dominating the texture-path category score. Texture rows also emit
phase-level diagnostic medians and tails, including texture creation,
texture write, view creation, render pipeline creation, submit/readback,
map/read, wait, and destroy where the scenario exercises those phases. Use
`--iters-texture` to set the texture sample count.

Render-readback L1 rows emit `renderMs` plus render-path phase timings so
adapter/device setup stays outside the render category score while remaining in
the raw scenario evidence.

For tuning one weak area without running the full diagnostic surface, pass one
or more focused categories:

```bash
./browser/chromium/scripts/run-consumer-bench.sh --headless true --focus-category texture --focus-category render
```

Focused reports remain diagnostic and carry `workloadFilter` counts. The
superset checker validates only rows in the selected categories and rejects
rows that leak in from outside the filter. Score sidecars copy the same
`workloadFilter` so focused scores are self-describing.

Default outputs are lane-local diagnostic artifacts under:

- `browser/chromium/artifacts/<timestamp>/dawn-vs-doe.browser-layered.superset.diagnostic.json`
- `browser/chromium/artifacts/<timestamp>/dawn-vs-doe.browser-layered.superset.check.json`
- `browser/chromium/artifacts/<timestamp>/dawn-vs-doe.browser-layered.superset.summary.json`

Repo-only browser ORT WebGPU evidence uses:

```bash
node browser/chromium/scripts/webgpu-playwright-ort-bench.mjs \
  --mode both \
  --task sentiment \
  --headless true \
  --timed-iters 5 \
  --warmup-iters 2
```

The current canonical compare artifact is:

- `bench/out/browser-ort-webgpu-compare/20260420T203851Z/browser.compare.json`

If you intentionally need `bench/out`, pass `--allow-bench-out` explicitly.
Diagnostic outputs under `bench/out` are restricted to `bench/out/scratch`.

## Cadence

1. Daily browser smoke runs.
2. Twice-weekly layered benchmark runs.
3. Weekly promotion review.

## Promotion Gate

Promotion candidates must pass:

1. hash-synchronized projection contract checks,
2. explicit status/statusCode evidence for required `L1/L2` rows,
3. promotion approvals matching the roles declared by the workflow manifest.
