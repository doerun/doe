-- DoeBuffer lifecycle state machine.
-- Mirrors: zig/src/doe_wgpu_native.zig DoeBuffer struct and exported operations.
-- Doe is intentionally more permissive than the WebGPU spec:
-- no precondition checks on mapAsync/unmap/getMappedRange/dispatch.
-- This module formally documents where Doe diverges from spec.

/-- Buffer states in Doe's lifecycle. -/
inductive BufferState where
  | unmapped   -- alive, not mapped (CPU access still works via UMA)
  | mapped     -- alive, mapped for CPU access
  | released   -- freed by doeBufferRelease, all access is undefined

-- Doe transition functions (match Zig implementation)

/-- doeBufferMapAsync: sets mapped=true. No precondition check in Doe. -/
