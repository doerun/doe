"""Synthesize the TSIR canary expansion preflight receipt.

Mitigates "TSIR kernel coverage", "TSIR backend coverage", and "TSIR
numerical statuses" from docs/cerebras-model-ledgers.md (Remaining
no-hardware evidence gaps).

Today the nightly TSIR parity canary covers 6 fixtures
(fused_gemv/rms_norm/gather × webgpu-generic/wse3) plus a partial
real-canary subset (fused_gemv real × 2 backends). This preflight
records:

  - the in-hand bootstrap canary state (3 kernels, 2 backends, 6
    fixtures, identity-chain pass),
  - the real-canary subset state (1 kernel passing + 1 kernel
    structurally blocked),
  - the expansion contract (4 additional real kernels + 2 additional
    backends = full real-canary at 12 fixture pairs),
  - the named blockers that prevent the expansion from running today:
      * doppler_transcript_arg_not_threaded — real kernels
        (rmsnorm/embed/lm_head_gemv/attention_*) require
        --doppler-transcript for the parity CLI; the canary does not
        yet pass it, so non-fused_gemv real kernels hit
        'parity CLI did not write a receipt'.
      * attention_bodyOp_schema_gap — TSIR semantic schema does not
        yet have an attention bodyOp; D3 must extend
        config/doe-tsir-semantic.schema.json before attention
        fixtures can carry meaningful realizations.
      * msl_spirv_canary_lanes_absent — emit_msl.zig and
        emit_spir_v.zig exist, but no canary fixtures pair them with
        bootstrap inputs. The real-canary expansion past 12 fixtures
        needs MSL + SPIR-V manifest entries for each kernel.
      * numerical_compare_oracle_not_wired — comparisons[].status[1]
        and [2] (numerical compare against reference, cross-backend
        hash agreement) are 'deferred' because the backend execution
        paths return 'not_implemented'. Wiring them requires running
        the WGSL via Doe-WebGPU and the CSL via simfabric for each
        fixture.

Authors the receipt at
bench/out/r3-1-tsir-canary-expansion-preflight/receipt.json with all
four named blockers and the contract for closing each.
