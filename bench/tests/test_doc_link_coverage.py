"""Lock markdown-link integrity across Doe docs.

Tick 19 found a load-bearing file (`docs/loop-protocol.md`) missing from
disk while `docs/status.md`, `docs/tsir-lowering-plan.md`, and every
recent status-shard entry linked to it. Nobody caught it for a long
time because there was no test for the class.

This test walks `docs/**/*.md` (excluding `docs/status/archive/`),
extracts every markdown link that resolves to a local relative path
inside the doe repo, and asserts the target exists on disk. External
URLs, cross-repo paths (e.g. `../../doppler/...`), and same-doc
anchors (`#section`) are skipped — those are valid references that
this test is not in a position to check.

Run: `python3 -m unittest bench.tests.test_doc_link_coverage`.
