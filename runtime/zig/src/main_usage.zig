        \\  command can be expressed as "kind", "command", or "command_kind"
        \\  kernel can be expressed as "kernel" or "kernel_name"
        \\  kernel_dispatch repeatSynchronization can be dependent or independent; default is dependent.
        \\--quirk-mode controls how quirks affect command execution.
        \\  off: no quirk processing; commands pass through unmodified.
        \\  trace: quirks are matched and traced, but commands are not modified for execution (default).
        \\  active: quirks are matched, traced, and command modifications are consumed by backends.
        \\If --quirks is omitted, the embedded sample profile is used.
        \\If --commands is omitted, the embedded sample command list is used.
        \\If --emit-normalized is set, emit canonicalized commands as ndjson and exit.
        \\Runtime output includes Lean-required flags when a matching quirk is selected.
        \\--trace prints machine-readable ndjson rows to stdout.
        \\--trace-jsonl writes machine-readable ndjson rows to a file.
        \\--trace-meta writes a deterministic run summary JSON artifact.
        \\--backend chooses execution backend when --execute is enabled.
        \\  trace: do not execute commands (trace-only mode)
        \\  native: execute through webgpu-native; dispatch/kernel_dispatch lower to compute passes, render_draw lowers to render-pass or render-bundle mode, and sampler/texture/surface/async diagnostics commands run through explicit WebGPU API contracts.
        \\--backend-lane selects backend selection policy lane when native execution is enabled.

        \\--command-repeat replays the loaded command stream N times in one execution.
        \\  benchmark runners use this instead of materializing repeated JSON arrays.
        \\--upload-buffer-usage selects upload buffer usage when --execute is enabled.
        \\  copy-dst-copy-src: create upload buffers with CopyDst|CopySrc (default).
        \\  copy-dst: create upload buffers with CopyDst only.
        \\--upload-submit-every submits and waits after every N upload commands (default: 1).
        \\--gpu-timestamp-mode controls native GPU timestamp query usage for kernel dispatch timings.
        \\  auto: use GPU timestamps when feature/query artifacts are available (default).
        \\  off: disable GPU timestamp attempts and rely on non-timestamp operation timing sources.
        \\  require: fail command execution when timestamp capture is unavailable or invalid.
        \\--queue-wait-mode controls queue completion waiting strategy for native execution.
        \\  process-events: callback + process-events loop (default).
        \\  wait-any: callback + wgpuInstanceWaitAny wait path (fails explicitly when unsupported).
        \\--queue-sync-mode controls when queue synchronization occurs.
        \\  per-command: waitForQueue after every submit (default).
        \\  deferred: skip per-submit waits; one final flush after the command loop.
        \\--numeric-stability-execution-profile selects the experimental
        \\  ordinary-execution numeric-governance profile from
        \\  config/numeric-stability-policy.json.
        \\  current built-in profiles:
        \\    numeric-stability/default-ordinary-execution-v1
        \\    numeric-stability/cautious-ordinary-execution-v1
        \\    numeric-stability/observe-only-ordinary-execution-v1
        \\--kernel-root provides a filesystem root for kernel lookup when kernel_dispatch is used.
        \\--replay validates current dispatch rows against a replay artifact path.
