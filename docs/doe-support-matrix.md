# Doe Support Matrix

## Purpose

This document defines explicit capability tiers for Doe with hard contracts per tier.

Every tier has: a deployment surface, a supported API set, required gates, conformance requirements, SLA/support commitments, and allowed marketing claims. Claims that exceed a tier's contract are disallowed regardless of directional evidence.

Tier names are tied to deployment surface and guarantees, not vague quality labels.

This document is the product-contract layer of a larger tracking model. Spec inventory and CTS evidence are separate layers. `config/webgpu-spec-index.jsonl` is the canonical WebGPU API spec index and per-backend checklist generated from the official `@webgpu/types` surface; `config/webgpu-cts-evidence.json` is the CTS evidence ledger; `config/webgpu-capability-inventory.json` remains the internal capability inventory only.

## Tiers

| Tier | Deployment Surface | Buyer |
|------|-------------------|-------|
| **doe-core** | Node/Bun/CLI headless | AI/ML infra, CI/perf teams |
| **doe-runtime** | Native apps, engines, embedded | Teams replacing Dawn/wgpu in applications |
| **chromium** | Managed Chromium distribution | Enterprise/regulated browser deployments |

Each tier is additive: doe-runtime includes all doe-core commitments; chromium includes all doe-runtime commitments.

## Compatibility matrix snapshot (2026-03-10)

This is the current evidence-backed compatibility read for Doe's active lanes.
Use it as the fast answer to "what is actually covered today?" and then follow
the tier contracts below for promotion requirements.

| Layer | Evidence source | Current scope | Current read | Immediate blocker |
|------|-----------------|---------------|--------------|-------------------|
| `doe-core` | `bench/out/amd-vulkan/20260310T153903Z/dawn-vs-doe.amd.vulkan.release.json` | 7 release workloads backed by 7 command examples on `amd|vulkan|gfx11|24.0.0` | `comparisonStatus=comparable`, `claimStatus=diagnostic` | `examples/upload_1kb_commands.json` is still a real tiny-upload loss in the latest release artifact |
| `doe-core` | `bench/out/apple-metal/extended-comparable/20260310T171918Z/dawn-vs-doe.local.metal.extended.comparable.json` | 31 comparable workloads backed by 30 unique command examples on `apple|metal|m3|1.0.0` | `comparisonStatus=comparable`, `claimStatus=diagnostic` | `examples/upload_1mb_commands.json` is diagnostic in the latest artifact because selected-timing `p95` is negative |
| `doe-runtime` | `bench/workloads/workloads.local.d3d12.json` | 11 governed comparable rows selected from the canonical D3D12 catalog (`cohorts=governed`, `benchmarkClass=comparable`) | contract only; no fresh Windows artifact in the current inventory | first Windows evidence run on GCP Windows Server + NVIDIA (G2/L4 recommended), then drop-in gate, CTS subset publication, and runtime-tier gates |
| `chromium` | `nursery/chromium/` lane docs only | browser integration lane exists in-repo | no fresh browser compatibility artifact in the current inventory | browser smoke evidence, rebase cadence, security-patch SLA, and operational commitments |

Current command-example coverage from active matrix artifacts/contracts:

- 30 unique command examples have fresh evidence in the latest AMD/Metal artifacts.
- 17 more command examples are wired into active workload contracts but absent from the latest published artifacts.
- 36 command examples are not referenced by any current smoke, extended, or release matrix.

The detailed file-level breakdown lives in `examples/README.md`.

## Surface and competitor matrix snapshot (2026-04-13)

The tier table above answers "what can Doe honestly claim today?".
This section answers the adjacent product question:
"which Doe surface exists on which host, against which competitor or
reference surface, and what is that cell for?"

Status vocabulary used below:

- `verified`: fresh evidence or an explicitly promoted governed lane exists
- `supported`: documented public surface exists, even if it is not itself a
  baseline/comparison claim lane
- `diagnostic`: useful for attribution, debugging, or local comparison, but not
  a canonical claim surface
- `scaffolded`: config/files/contracts exist, but fresh evidence or release
  maturity is missing
- `possible`: technically viable from current contracts, but not productized or
  governed today
- `not meaningful`: not a product cell we should try to fill

Subpath reminder:

- `doe-gpu` is the public npm package surface
- `doe-gpu/compute`, `doe-gpu/browser`, and `doe-gpu/hybrid` are exported
  subpaths inside that one package family
- repo-only benchmark, browser, and release tooling under `bench/` and
  `browser/chromium/` is not part of the npm package contract
- legacy `@simulatte/*` names are compatibility history, not primary product
  framing

Current ORT evidence to read alongside the table below:

- Node ORT provider compare artifact:
  `bench/out/node-ort-webgpu-provider-compare/20260413T191817Z/gemma270m.claim.json`
- Node ORT provider breadth artifact:
  `bench/out/node-ort-webgpu-provider-breadth/20260413T192150Z/breadth.compare.json`
- Bun ORT provider compare artifact:
  `bench/out/bun-ort-webgpu-provider-compare/gemma270m-prefill32-decode1.claim.json`
- Bun ORT provider breadth artifact:
  `bench/out/bun-ort-webgpu-provider-breadth/20260413T181619Z/breadth.compare.json`
- Browser ORT canonical compare artifact:
  `bench/out/browser-ort-webgpu-compare/20260413T193605Z/browser.compare.json`
- Native ORT EP proof slice:
  `runtime/bridge/onnxruntime-ep/artifacts/20260413T172955Z/doe-ort-ep-session-smoke.json`
- Native ORT EP bench reports:
  `bench/out/native-ort-doe-ep/matmul.report.json`,
  `bench/out/native-ort-doe-ep/matmul_add.report.json`,
  `bench/out/native-ort-doe-ep/matmul_add_relu.report.json`, and
  `bench/out/native-ort-webgpu-provider/20260413T175708Z/basic-ops.claim.json`

### Runtime package family: `doe-gpu`

| Host / platform | Doe surface | Reference surface | Kind | Current state | Value / note |
|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| Node | `doe-gpu` | `webgpu` (Dawn) | product + governed compare lane | `diagnostic` | Public package surface exists and governed Node package lanes exist. ORT evidence now also exists in-repo through the same-stack provider compare lane; read current Node ORT results artifact-by-artifact because the broader Vulkan-host ORT matrix is mixed. |
| Bun | `doe-gpu` | `bun-webgpu` (Dawn) | product + governed compare lane | `verified` | Main Bun package niche for package-plan benchmarking, and the repo now also has a same-stack Bun ORT WebGPU provider-compare lane with a fresh local Gemma-3 270M claim artifact. |
| Deno | `doe-gpu` via `packages/doe-gpu/src/deno.js` | built-in Deno WebGPU (`navigator.gpu`, wgpu-backed) | product + governed compare lane | `verified` | Deno package lane now exists in-repo and is registered as `deno_package_compare`; still newer than Node/Bun and should be read lane-specifically. |
| Node / Bun / Deno | `createDoeRuntime()`, `runDawnVsDoeCompare()` | no package-surface incumbent | advanced helper surface | `supported` | Public helper exports exist, but compare/release operator CLIs live in-repo under `bench/` and are not npm-shipped tools. |
| Node | historical `native-direct` helper shape | raw competitor device surfaces in ad hoc four-way compares | diagnostic subpath | `diagnostic` | Useful for stripping wrapper noise out of Node package attribution. Not a public replacement promise by itself. |
| Browser | `doe-gpu/browser` | browser `navigator.gpu` | package helper surface | `supported` | Public browser package entrypoint exists, but governed browser comparison/evidence lives under `browser/chromium/`, not under the npm package family by itself. |

### Legacy helper compatibility note

Legacy `@simulatte/webgpu-doe` usage is historical compatibility surface, not a
second current package family. The transport-free helper idea still matters,
but the product framing should stay on `doe-gpu`.

| Host / platform | Legacy helper binding | Reference surface | Kind | Current state | Value / note |
|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| Node / Bun / Deno | `@simulatte/webgpu-doe` bound onto Doe runtime objects | same underlying Doe runtime | helper compatibility surface | `supported` | Historical helper shape retained for compatibility/migration context only. |
| Node | `@simulatte/webgpu-doe` bound onto `webgpu` raw devices | Dawn-backed Node runtime | attribution / compatibility cell | `diagnostic` | Still relevant for old attribution experiments, but not a primary product surface. |
| Bun | `@simulatte/webgpu-doe` bound onto `bun-webgpu` raw devices | Dawn-backed Bun runtime | compatibility cell | `possible` | Technically within the old helper contract, but not a promoted current package story. |
| Deno | `@simulatte/webgpu-doe` bound onto built-in Deno WebGPU devices | wgpu-backed Deno runtime | compatibility cell | `possible` | Allowed by the old transport-free helper model; not the preferred framing anymore. |
| Browser | `@simulatte/webgpu-doe` bound onto browser-provided `GPUDevice` objects | stock browser WebGPU surfaces | helper compatibility surface | `supported` | Useful for legacy browser-helper framing, but still not a Doe runtime replacement claim. |
| Any host | `@simulatte/webgpu-doe` treated as a standalone WebGPU runtime | runtime incumbents | product cell | `not meaningful` | The helper package does not ship Doe's direct backend implementation path and should not be described as a runtime replacement. |

### Runtime, ABI, and browser cells

| Host / platform | Doe surface | Reference surface | Kind | Current state | Value / note |
|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| macOS Apple Silicon | Doe Metal backend | Dawn Metal delegate | governed runtime compare lane | `verified` | Strong Doe-vs-Dawn direct-backend evidence exists, but the current broad full lane remains diagnostic rather than fully claimable. |
| Linux AMD Vulkan | Doe Vulkan backend | Dawn Vulkan delegate | governed runtime compare lane | `verified` | Real Doe-vs-Dawn runtime evidence exists; the current strict release lane remains diagnostic with one remaining upload blocker. |
| Windows D3D12 | Doe D3D12 backend | Dawn D3D12 delegate | governed runtime compare lane | `scaffolded` | Contracts, configs, and runtime path exist, but the current inventory still lacks a fresh Windows evidence artifact. Recommended path to first evidence: GCP Windows Server 2022 + NVIDIA (G2/L4). D3D12 is fully supported on NVIDIA on Windows Server; initial results will be directional, not claimable, pending D3D12-specific Dawn mapping validation. |
| Native apps / engines / embedded | `libwebgpu_doe.{so,dylib,dll}` drop-in runtime | Dawn / wgpu via `webgpu.h` ABI | runtime replacement target | `scaffolded` | `docs/status.md` now points at a publishable Apple Metal runtime bundle with stripped dylib, hashes/sizes, drop-in gate, native consumer, compare-dev, sync/timing gates, and CTS publication, but the broader runtime tier is still missing non-Apple runtime slices and backend-wide release publication. |
| Any `webgpu.h` host | Doe shared-library ABI surface | Dawn ABI / `webgpu.h` expectations | validation cell | `scaffolded` | Fresh Apple dylib ABI/runtime validation is now bundled in `docs/status.md`, but full validation across the intended runtime hosts/backends is still incomplete. |
| Chromium / Doe browser lane | Doe as browser `navigator.gpu` runtime | Chromium / Chrome Dawn path | browser compare / smoke cell | `diagnostic` | Browser lane exists and is governed, but current browser evidence is still separate from claim-grade native/package replacement language. |

### Exhaustiveness notes

The matrix above is intentionally exhaustive across the named surfaces that
exist in the repo today:

- runtime package family
  - Node, Bun, Deno, CLI, and the Node-only `native-direct` diagnostic subpath
- helper package family
  - bound to Doe runtime surfaces, competitor runtime surfaces, and browser
    `GPUDevice` surfaces
- native/runtime/browser deployment tiers
  - Metal, Vulkan, D3D12, drop-in ABI, and browser integration

Cells not listed separately are intentionally folded into one of those rows:

- `doe-gpu/compute`, `doe-gpu/browser`, and `doe-gpu/hybrid` are API-shape
  entrypoints inside the same runtime package family, not separate competitive
  surfaces
- legacy `@simulatte/webgpu/node` and `@simulatte/webgpu/bun` names are
  host-specific history aliases of the same package family and inherit the same
  lane status as their current `doe-gpu` parent rows
- browser competitors are represented at the browser tier, not duplicated under
  the npm package family

### Tracking model

- Product contract: this document and the package contract docs define what each surface is allowed to promise.
- Spec index and backend checklist: `config/webgpu-spec-index.jsonl` tracks the WebGPU API surface by official interface/member and string-union enum from `@webgpu/types`, and now carries per-backend checklist cells for `metal`, `vulkan`, `d3d12`, and `browser`, each split into `implementation`, `correctness`, and `performance` evidence. WGSL builtins/types remain a follow-up layer.
- CTS evidence: `config/webgpu-cts-evidence.json` tracks actual CTS runs, query buckets, pass/fail results, and artifact paths.
- Internal capability inventory: `config/webgpu-capability-inventory.json` remains useful for Doe implementation tracking, but it is not the spec index and it is not CTS evidence.
- Chromium integration overlay: `config/webgpu-integration-chromium.json` records what changes when the browser lane runs through the wire protocol and browser-owned media/image paths.
- Generated surface views: `config/generated/webgpu-surface-{compute,headless,chromium}.json` are convenience reports derived from the canonical ledgers above; they are not source-of-truth files.

## Tier 1: doe-core

### Scope

Headless compute, benchmarking, and evidence infrastructure via Node/Bun/CLI.

### Deployment surface

- `doe-gpu` (Node runtime, Bun FFI, Deno, CLI-adjacent helper surface)
- `doe-zig-runtime` CLI binary
- `libwebgpu_doe.{dylib,so,dll}` via FFI (compute-focused paths)
- browser/runtime replacement packaging beyond the headless package name belongs to the `doe-runtime` tier, not a separate public package name today

### Supported API

From the `doe-gpu` API contract v1:

| API | Status | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| `create(createArgs?)` | Required | Returns provider-backed GPU object with `requestAdapter` |
| `globals` | Required | Provider globals for `globalThis` bootstrap |
| `setupGlobals(target?, createArgs?)` | Required | Installs `navigator.gpu` + enum bootstrap |
| `requestAdapter(adapterOptions?, createArgs?)` | Required | Returns `Promise<GPUAdapter \| null>` when provider supports in-process adapter callbacks |
| `requestDevice(options?)` | Required | Returns `Promise<GPUDevice>` when provider supports in-process adapter/device callbacks |
| `createDoeRuntime(options?)` | Required | Advanced helper surface for `runRaw` and `runBench` orchestration |
| `runDawnVsDoeCompare(options)` | Required | Advanced helper that wraps repo compare tooling when the compare assets are present |
| `providerInfo()` | Required | Module/load diagnostics |

Package boundary:

- `doe-gpu` does not ship compare or release npm CLI binaries.
- Canonical compare/release operator entrypoints live in the repo under `bench/`.
- See `docs/internal-tooling.md` for the tooling boundary contract.

### Not supported

- Full browser-parity `navigator.gpu` object model emulation
- Full WebGPU enum surface (only constants required by real integrations)
- `GPUCanvasContext`, presentation/swapchain APIs
- Full object lifetime/event parity (`device lost` events, full error scopes, full mapping semantics)
- npm `webgpu` drop-in compatibility guarantee for arbitrary packages
- Doe-native Bun FFI callback trampoline for `wgpuInstanceRequestAdapter`/`wgpuAdapterRequestDevice` (in progress)

### Required gates

| Gate | Mode | Script |
|------|------|--------|
| Schema | Blocking | `bench/gates/schema_gate.py` |
| Correctness | Blocking | `bench/gates/check_correctness.py` |
| Trace/replay | Blocking | `bench/gates/trace_gate.py` |
| Comparability | Blocking | `bench/cli.py compare --strict` |
| Claim | Blocking for claim artifacts | `bench/gates/claim_gate.py` |
| Performance | Advisory | `gates.json` ratchet |

### Conformance requirements

- No CTS publication requirement.
- Correctness is validated by internal trace replay and comparability gates, not external CTS.
- Behavioral correctness for supported operations (buffer upload, copy, barrier, dispatch, render) must pass internal gate suite.

### SLA / support commitments

- Artifact reproducibility: any published benchmark artifact must be reproducible from the same inputs, config, and runtime version.
- Gate stability: blocking gates must not regress (pass→fail) without a tracked config or code change.
- API stability: the `doe-gpu` API contract v1 surface is stable; breaking changes require version bump.
- No uptime/availability SLA (headless tooling, not a service).

### Allowed marketing claims

| Claim | Allowed | Condition |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| "Strict apples-to-apples Dawn comparison on [N] workloads" | Yes | Cite artifact path, `comparisonStatus=comparable`, `claimStatus=claimable` |
| "Deterministic trace and replay for GPU workloads" | Yes | Trace gate passes |
| "Hash-linked benchmark artifacts" | Yes | Artifacts conform to trace-meta schema |
| "Faster than Dawn on [specific workloads]" | Yes | Per claim discipline rules (artifact, workload set, backend, timing class, claimStatus) |
| "Dawn replacement" | No | Requires doe-runtime tier |
| "Production WebGPU runtime" | No | Requires doe-runtime tier |
| "Conformant WebGPU implementation" | No | Requires doe-runtime tier with CTS publication |

---

## Tier 2: doe-runtime

### Scope

Drop-in native WebGPU runtime for applications, engines, and embedded systems. Replaces Dawn or wgpu as the `webgpu.h` provider.

### Deployment surface

- `libwebgpu_doe.so` / `libwebgpu_doe.dylib` as shared library
- Static linking for embedded targets
- All doe-core surfaces (Node/Bun/CLI)

### Supported API

All of doe-core, plus:

| API | Status | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| `webgpu.h` ABI | Required | Full symbol set verified by `dropin_gate.py` |
| `wgpuCreateInstance` | Required | Via shared library export |
| `wgpuInstanceRequestAdapter` | Required | Callback-based per `webgpu.h` spec |
| `wgpuAdapterRequestDevice` | Required | Callback-based per `webgpu.h` spec |
| Buffer operations | Required | Create, map, unmap, write, copy |
| Texture operations | Required | Create, write, copy, view |
| Render pipeline | Required | Create, bind, draw, draw indexed |
| Compute pipeline | Required | Create, bind, dispatch |
| Command encoding | Required | Full `GPUCommandEncoder` surface |
| Queue operations | Required | Submit, writeBuffer, writeTexture, onSubmittedWorkDone |

### Expanded scope vs doe-core

| Capability | doe-core | doe-runtime |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `webgpu.h` ABI completeness | Partial (compute paths) | Full (verified by gate) |
| Render pipeline | Not required | Required |
| Texture operations | Not required | Required |
| Presentation/swapchain | Not required | Required only for windowed/browser-integrated targets |
| Error scopes | Not required | Required |
| Device lost events | Not required | Required |
| Shader module creation | Via helper/runtime tooling | In-process via `webgpu.h` |

### Not supported

- Browser-specific presentation integration (swapchain is native-window, not `GPUCanvasContext`)
- Chromium GPU process integration
- Browser security sandbox enforcement (that is chromium)

### Required gates

All doe-core gates, plus:

| Gate | Mode | Script |
|------|------|--------|
| Drop-in ABI | Blocking | `bench/dropin_gate.py` |
| CTS subset | Blocking | Target: selected CTS subset at published pass rate |
| Backend selection | Blocking | `run_blocking_gates.py --with-backend-selection-gate` |
| Sync conformance | Blocking per backend | Metal: `--with-metal-sync-conformance-gate`; Vulkan: `--with-vulkan-sync-conformance-gate` |
| Timing policy | Blocking per backend | Metal: `--with-metal-timing-policy-gate`; Vulkan: `--with-vulkan-timing-policy-gate` |
| Shader artifact | Blocking | `--with-shader-artifact-gate` |

### Conformance requirements

- **CTS subset publication required.** Select a meaningful CTS subset covering implemented operations. Publish pass/fail counts per backend per release. Track trend.
- **Minimum pass rate target:** To be established after first CTS run. Initial publication of any number (even low) is required; trend direction matters more than absolute value.
- **Regression policy:** CTS pass rate must not regress between releases. Any regression blocks release until fixed or explicitly waived with tracking in `docs/status.md`.

### SLA / support commitments

All doe-core commitments, plus:

- ABI stability: `webgpu.h` symbol set does not break between minor versions. Symbol additions are non-breaking; symbol removal or signature change requires major version bump.
- Binary artifact availability: stripped shared library published per release, per backend (Metal, Vulkan), per target (macOS arm64, Linux x86_64, etc.).
- Binary size and build time: published per release, compared against Dawn baseline.
- Conformance trend: CTS subset results published per release.
- Bug response: issues with reproducible trace artifacts get priority triage.

### Allowed marketing claims

All doe-core claims, plus:

| Claim | Allowed | Condition |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| "Drop-in Dawn/wgpu replacement" | Yes | `dropin_gate.py` passes, CTS subset published |
| "Lighter than Dawn" | Yes | Only with published binary size + build time + dependency count comparison |
| "Conformance-tracked WebGPU runtime" | Yes | CTS subset results published |
| "Production WebGPU runtime" | Yes | All blocking gates green, CTS published, at least one external consumer validated |
| "Full WebGPU implementation" | No | Until CTS pass rate exceeds threshold (TBD) |
| "Browser-ready" | No | Requires chromium tier |
| "Formally verified" | No | Until Lean proof pipeline is operational in CI with specific scope documented |

---

## Tier 3: chromium

### Scope

Managed Chromium distribution with Doe as the WebGPU runtime. Deployable as an enterprise/regulated browser product.

### Consumer hardware coverage plan

Chromium-tier validation must cover real Chrome/WebGPU behavior, not just OS
availability. The practical first-pass matrix is:

| Lane | Host type | GPU class | Why it matters |
|------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| macOS baseline | physical Mac mini or MacBook | Apple Silicon integrated GPU | Mainstream Chrome/macOS consumer path |
| Windows Intel baseline | physical laptop or mini PC | Intel integrated GPU | Common laptop path and low-power adapter behavior |
| Windows AMD baseline | physical laptop or mini PC | AMD integrated GPU | Common APU path with different driver behavior |
| Windows high tier | physical desktop/laptop or cloud | NVIDIA discrete GPU | Main high-end Windows/perf lane |
| Linux baseline | physical mini PC or laptop | AMD integrated GPU | Best practical Linux consumer lane with fewer vendor-specific surprises |
| Linux high tier | physical desktop or cloud | NVIDIA discrete GPU | Add when Linux performance is a serious support surface |

Use physical machines for integrated-GPU consumer coverage. Use cloud for
repeatable NVIDIA Windows/Linux automation and burst reruns. Do not make every
machine a performance lane: most of the Chromium matrix should answer
compatibility and regression questions before it answers benchmarking
questions.

### Deployment surface

- Chromium fork binary (macOS, Linux, Windows)
- Doe integrated as `--use-webgpu-runtime=doe`
- All doe-runtime surfaces available via Chromium's GPU process

### Supported API

All of doe-runtime, plus:

| API | Status | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| `navigator.gpu` | Required | Full browser WebGPU API via Doe backend |
| `GPUCanvasContext` | Required | Browser presentation integration |
| Chromium GPU process integration | Required | Doe runs in GPU process with sandbox |
| Chromium flags | Required | `--use-webgpu-runtime=doe`, `--disable-webgpu-doe`, `--doe-webgpu-library-path` |

### Expanded scope vs doe-runtime

| Capability | doe-runtime | chromium |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| Browser `navigator.gpu` | Not supported | Required |
| `GPUCanvasContext` / presentation | Native-window only | Browser tab integration |
| GPU process sandbox | Not applicable | Required |
| Security patch cadence | Not applicable | Required SLA |
| Upstream rebase | Not applicable | Required cadence |
| Rollback to Dawn | Explicit lane/config selection only (no runtime override switch) | Managed, policy-driven |

### Not supported at launch

- Full WebGPU spec conformance parity with Chrome/Dawn (may lag on edge cases)
- WebGPU extensions not in `webgpu.h` core
- WebCodecs GPU integration (future)

### Required gates

All doe-runtime gates, plus:

| Gate | Mode | Script |
|------|------|--------|
| Cycle lock/rollback | Blocking | `bench/gates/cycle_gate.py` |
| Cutover verification | Blocking per lane | `--with-local-metal-gates --local-metal-lane metal_doe_app` |
| Claim rehearsal | Required for release claims | `bench/tools/build_claim_rehearsal_artifacts.py` |
| Substantiation | Required for trend publication | `bench/runners/run_release_claim_windows.py` |

### Conformance requirements

All doe-runtime requirements, plus:

- **Expanded CTS coverage:** CTS subset must cover browser-visible API surface, not just compute/buffer operations.
- **Browser smoke tests:** Standard WebGPU samples (rotating cube, compute boids, deferred rendering) must render correctly in the Doe Chromium lane.
- **Regression gate:** No CTS regression and no browser smoke test regression between releases.

### Operational commitments

| Commitment | Target | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Security patch cadence | Within 72 hours of Chrome stable security update | GPU process CVEs prioritized |
| Upstream rebase cadence | Per Chrome major release (every 4 weeks) | Doe integration isolated to minimize conflict surface |
| Rollback policy | Runtime backend override switch removed; use explicit lane/config policy | Deterministic recovery via audited policy updates |
| Diff size tracking | Published per release | Doe Chromium lane vs upstream Chromium diff LOC tracked; growing diff requires justification |
| Release cadence | Monthly minimum, aligned with Chrome stable | Hotfix releases for security within SLA |

### Fork maintenance contracts

| Area | Contract |
|------|----------|
| Isolation boundary | The Doe Chromium lane modifies only: `third_party/dawn/` replacement surface, GPU process initialization/runtime selection, `webgpu.h` binding layer, and packaging/branding/launcher metadata required for distribution. All other Chromium code tracked upstream without modification. |
| Rebase strategy | Cherry-pick security patches immediately. Full rebase per Chrome major release. Merge conflicts in the isolation boundary are resolved by the Doe team; conflicts outside that boundary indicate scope creep. |
| Diff ceiling | If the Doe Chromium lane diff exceeds 50K LOC (excluding `third_party/dawn/` replacement), trigger architectural review to re-isolate. |
| Security audit | Doe runtime code in GPU process is in-scope for security review. Sandbox boundary behavior must match Dawn's guarantees or explicitly document deviations. |

### Allowed marketing claims

All doe-runtime claims, plus:

| Claim | Allowed | Condition |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| "Managed browser with controlled GPU behavior" | Yes | Operational commitments met, at least one release shipped |
| "Independent GPU runtime patching" | Yes | Demonstrated by shipping a Doe fix without waiting for Chrome release |
| "Auditable GPU behavior" | Yes | Trace/replay operational in browser context |
| "Enterprise-grade browser" | Yes | Security patch SLA demonstrated over 3+ release cycles |
| "Regulated/sovereign browser" | Yes | All operational commitments met + hash-linked artifact chain operational |
| "FedRAMP/HIPAA/IL4+ ready" | No | Until actual certification or compliance audit completed |
| "Formally verified browser" | No | Until Lean proof pipeline is operational with documented scope |

## Layer escalation guidance

Use the lowest layer that can honestly describe the current evidence. Do not
escalate a command stream, package surface, or marketing claim just because the
code path exists.

1. Keep an item at example-only status when it is merely schema-valid or locally useful.
   It is not yet a supported compatibility claim if it lacks a workload
   contract and a fresh artifact.

2. Escalate an example into `doe-core` only when all of the following are true:
   it is wired into a versioned workload contract, the latest artifact records
   successful execution with blocking obligations passing, and the example's
   status is documented as fresh evidence or diagnostic in `examples/README.md`.

3. Treat `diagnostic` examples as evidence-bearing but non-promotable.
   They are valid for debugging and regression tracking, but they do not justify
   "faster", "supported", or broader replacement language for that lane.

4. Escalate from `doe-core` to `doe-runtime` only after the runtime-visible
   surface is proven outside the package/CLI layer: `webgpu.h` ABI coverage,
   `dropin_gate.py`, CTS subset publication, callback/device creation, and the
   backend-specific blocking gates required by this document.

5. Escalate from `doe-runtime` to `chromium` only after the browser lane
   has its own evidence: Chromium boot with Doe selected, browser smoke tests,
   rebase cadence, security-patch cadence, and rollback validation. Native
   runtime evidence does not automatically transfer to the browser tier.

6. Demote quickly when the latest artifact regresses.
   If a lane flips from claimable to diagnostic, or from fresh evidence to
   contract-only, the docs must immediately stop using the higher-status label.

This guidance is intentionally conservative: fresh artifacts outrank older
claimable runs, and explicit lane evidence outranks assumptions from nearby
layers.

## Claim discipline by tier

The claim discipline rules from [`docs/claim-discipline.md`](claim-discipline.md) apply universally, but the *scope* of allowed claims differs by tier:

| Rule | doe-core | doe-runtime | chromium |
|------|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Performance claims require artifact citation | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| No generalization beyond covered workloads | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Regression blocks "faster" language | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| "Replacement" language allowed | No | Yes (with CTS) | Yes |
| "Production" language allowed | No | Yes (with gates) | Yes |
| "Enterprise/regulated" language allowed | No | No | Yes (with SLA) |
| "Conformant" language allowed | No | Yes (with CTS trend) | Yes |
| "Sovereign" language allowed | No | No | Yes (full stack) |

## Relationship to AI workloads

AI workload stacks are consumers of Doe, not tiers of Doe. Representative tier requirements:

| AI workload use case | Minimum Doe Tier | Reason |
|-----------------|-----------------|--------|
| Browser inference on stock WebGPU | None (uses Dawn/wgpu via host browser) | Doe not involved |
| Headless inference via Node provider module | doe-core | Needs `requestAdapter`/`requestDevice` in Node |
| Vertically integrated browser AI stack | chromium | Needs browser-integrated `navigator.gpu` on Doe |
| Sovereign AI stack (all three) | chromium | Full stack requires all tiers |

AI workload stacks can ship value today on stock WebGPU (no Doe dependency). The Doe integration path adds value incrementally as tiers mature.

## Current status (2026-03-28)

| Tier | Status | Blocking Gaps |
|------|--------|--------------|
| doe-core | **Operational (CLI/process-bridge)** | Fresh strict evidence exists on AMD Vulkan and Apple Metal, but the latest artifacts are still overall diagnostic (`upload_1kb` on AMD release, `upload_1mb` on Apple Metal comparable). Provider-module in-process path still depends on provider callbacks; Doe-native Bun FFI adapter trampoline remains incomplete. |
| doe-runtime | **Not yet shippable** | Fresh Apple Metal runtime release bundle now packages ABI gate, stripped binary metadata, native consumer validation, compare-dev, Metal sync/timing gates, and CTS publication, but non-Apple runtime slices and fresh Windows D3D12 runtime evidence are still missing. |
| chromium | **Not yet shippable** | No rebase cadence demonstrated, no security patch SLA, no browser smoke tests, operational commitments undocumented |
