# Internal tooling

This document separates Doe's repo-only tooling from its public package
surface.

The canonical machine-readable contract is [`config/tool-surfaces.json`](../config/tool-surfaces.json).
If prose and tooling metadata disagree, treat the schema-backed manifest as the
source of truth.

## Public package surface

The current public package contract is:

- `doe-gpu`
- its documented subpath exports, including `api`, `native`, `plan`, `capture`,
  `compute`, `browser`, and compatibility `hybrid`
- the package docs in [`packages/doe-gpu/README.md`](../packages/doe-gpu/README.md)

Advanced helper exports such as `createDoeRuntime()` and
`runDawnVsDoeCompare()` are still part of the package surface, but they are
repo-adjacent helpers, not the canonical operator front doors for benchmark or
release work.

The npm package does not ship compare, bench, or release pipeline CLIs.
It also does not ship a public `doe-gpu/csl` subpath until the CSL HostPlan and
receipt contracts are stable enough to treat as semver package surface.

## Internal operator tooling

These are repo-only contributor/operator surfaces:

- [`bench/cli.py`](../bench/cli.py)
- [`bench/runners/run_release_pipeline.py`](../bench/runners/run_release_pipeline.py)
- [`bench/runners/run_blocking_gates.py`](../bench/runners/run_blocking_gates.py)
- [`bench/tools/generate_backend_workloads.py`](../bench/tools/generate_backend_workloads.py)
- TSIR parity tooling ([`bench/tools/doe_parity.py`](../bench/tools/doe_parity.py),
  [`bench/tools/tsir_manifest_lowering.py`](../bench/tools/tsir_manifest_lowering.py),
  [`bench/gates/nightly_tsir_parity_canary.py`](../bench/gates/nightly_tsir_parity_canary.py));
  full surface + fixtures enumerated in
  [`bench/README.md`](../bench/README.md) §TSIR parity tooling
- [`runtime/zig/README.md`](../runtime/zig/README.md) and `doe-zig-runtime`
- browser benchmark scripts under [`browser/chromium`](../browser/chromium/README.md)

Repo-only directories should not be treated as public product commitments unless
`config/tool-surfaces.json` marks them `audience=public`.

In practice:

- `bench/`, `browser/chromium/`, `cts/`, `examples/`, `pipeline/`, top-level
  `scripts/`, and `demos/` are internal
- `packages/doe-gpu/` is the public npm surface
- overlapping helpers are allowed, but repo workflows are still owned by the
  repo tooling, not by the npm package

## Archive and deprecated areas

These areas exist for migration, reference, or research and should not be read
as active public product surfaces:

- legacy npm names `@simulatte/webgpu` and `@simulatte/webgpu-doe`
- `dawn-research/`
- `nursery/`

Experimental demo applications stay under `demos/`, but they are still
repo-only/internal unless the surface manifest explicitly marks them public.

When a question is about public package behavior, ignore archive and repo-only
tooling unless the user explicitly asks about them.
