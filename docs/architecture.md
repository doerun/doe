# Doe architecture

## System surfaces

Doe has three user-facing/runtime-adjacent surfaces and two supporting layers.

1. `runtime/zig`
   The core Doe runtime: WGSL pipeline, backend execution, runtime artifacts,
   and shared-library outputs.
2. `packages/doe-gpu`
   The JavaScript package surface for Node.js, Bun, Deno, and browser-facing
   wrappers.
3. `browser/chromium`
   The Chromium lane: docs, contracts, scripts, and probes for the future
   browser-runtime integration path.
4. `bench`
   Compare harnesses, gates, and evidence workflows.
5. `pipeline/*` plus `config/*`
   Quirk mining, proof artifacts, trace/replay contracts, schemas, and policy.

These surfaces are related, but they are not interchangeable.

They also sit at different maturity levels. Dawn remains the WebGPU runtime
used in Chromium and much of the browser ecosystem; Doe's present scope is
the runtime/package/native boundary, while the Chromium lane remains a future
integration track.

## Product boundary rules

The important boundary distinctions are:

- `runtime/zig` is the real runtime implementation
- `runtime/bridge/onnxruntime-ep` is a repo-only integration seam for a future Doe-backed ONNX Runtime plugin EP
- `doe-gpu` is the package surface over that runtime
- `doe-gpu/browser` is a browser wrapper, not the Doe runtime running inside the browser
- `browser/chromium` is the future browser-runtime lane, not the current package wrapper
- `bench` measures surfaces; it is not itself a product surface

Current scope:

- Dawn is the comparison baseline
- Doe runs in Node.js, Bun, Deno, drop-in, and embedded/native lanes
- a Doe-backed ONNX Runtime plugin EP is a repo-only experimental integration seam
- browser `navigator.gpu` replacement is an explicit future lane, not the current package claim

That separation is deliberate. It keeps package ergonomics, runtime behavior,
and browser integration from getting blurred together in docs or benchmarks.

## Core module flow

At a high level, Doe works like this:

1. `pipeline/agent`
   Mines upstream quirk/workaround signals and normalizes them into structured
   records.
2. `config`
   Holds schemas, policies, workload contracts, and versioned control data.
3. `pipeline/lean`
   Formalizes selected obligations and emits proof artifacts when enabled.
4. `runtime/zig`
   Consumes config and optional proof artifacts, then executes the runtime on
   Metal, Vulkan, or D3D12.
5. `bench` and `pipeline/trace`
   Verify correctness, comparability, replayability, and claimability from
   emitted artifacts.

The current Lean theorem inventory is recorded in
`pipeline/lean/artifacts/proven-conditions.json`; architecture docs should
refer to that artifact rather than restating counts.

## Execution model

Doe is designed around explicit runtime behavior:

- backend selection is policy/config driven
- strict lanes do not silently fallback
- unsupported capabilities fail with typed, actionable errors
- hot-path behavior stays in Zig unless it can be hoisted out by proof/config

Current native backend identities are:

- `doe_metal`
- `doe_vulkan`
- `doe_d3d12`
- `dawn_delegate` as the Dawn-comparison lane

## Verification boundary

Doe supports two broad modes:

1. Ahead-of-time verified execution
   Selected invariants are proven offline and used to remove runtime work.
2. Runtime-checked execution
   Zig keeps the necessary dynamic checks for untrusted inputs.

The design rule is:

1. implement deterministic behavior in Zig first
2. measure it
3. move conditions into proof/config only when that lets Doe delete runtime
   branches safely

## Browser lane split

There are two distinct browser-related paths:

1. `packages/doe-gpu/browser`
   A JS shim that forwards to the browser's own WebGPU objects. No Doe Zig
   runtime executes there.
2. `browser/chromium`
   The Track A lane that aims to make browser `navigator.gpu` run on Doe
   instead of Dawn.

Those paths answer different questions and should not be described as the same
thing.

They also sit at different maturity levels. The browser shim is a present
compatibility surface. The Chromium lane is a future integration track against
the Dawn-based runtime browsers ship today.

## Build and evidence outputs

A useful Doe build/run can emit:

- runtime artifact(s)
- run metadata
- trace or trace-meta artifacts
- benchmark reports
- optional proof artifacts and hashes

The artifact chain matters as much as the code. Doe treats claims as valid only
when they are tied back to those emitted contracts.
