# Doe architecture

## System surfaces

Doe exposes one execution product through packages and native embedding, with
optional integrations and shared evidence tooling.

1. `runtime/zig`
   The core Doe runtime: WGSL pipeline, backend execution, runtime artifacts,
   and shared-library outputs.
2. `packages/doe-gpu`
   The JavaScript package surface for Node.js, Bun, Deno, and browser-facing
   wrappers.
3. `browser/chromium`
   The experimental Fawn/Chromium distribution lane: integration contracts, release
   packaging, clean-install verification, browser probes, and evidence gates.
4. `bench`
   Compare harnesses, gates, and evidence workflows.
5. `pipeline/*` plus `config/*`
   Quirk mining, proof artifacts, trace/replay contracts, schemas, and policy.

These surfaces are related, but they are not interchangeable.

They also sit at different maturity levels. Dawn remains the WebGPU runtime
used in Chromium and much of the browser ecosystem. Doe's native/package lane
has physical evidence; Fawn is an experimental distribution target whose
current browser evidence remains diagnostic.

## Strategic decomposition

Doe owns an independent execution product. Controlled package/native hosts
provide the compatibility entry; explicitly declared repeated programs expose
work that can be prepared and retained. The decomposition is:

1. **Program identity preservation**
   Source-preserving execution and multi-backend lowering are the same concern:
   preserving source/program identity from input through every lowered artifact
   and execution receipt. WGSL, Doe IR, TSIR, HostPlan, CSL, MSL, SPIR-V,
   DXIL/HLSL, command graphs, and trace receipts must stay linked by explicit
   hashes and contracts.
2. **Independent native runtime surface**
   The native WebGPU runtime path remains its own product surface:
   `doe-zig-runtime`, `libwebgpu_doe`, the JavaScript package bindings, and
   native/drop-in lanes. Chromium integration should prove this runtime in a
   browser process model; it should not collapse the runtime product into a
   browser fork.
3. **Evidence and trust discipline**
   Receipt-backed claims and compiler/proof discipline are one trust system.
   A claim against Tint, Dawn, or Chromium is valid only when the relevant
   compiler evidence, runtime trace, browser diagnostic, proof artifact, or
   benchmark report satisfies the gate for that surface.

The shared execution unit for that trust system is a correctness-bearing
workload. Pure transforms, native runtimes, browsers, and comparisons are
executor adapters beneath one contract. The core ledger stays executor-neutral
and binds specialized evidence through typed extensions; see
[`workload-system.md`](workload-system.md).

## Architectural law: Hexagonal inside, vertically integrated outside

1. **Inside the Zig Runtime:** Decoupled, contract-governed, and acyclic
   (`src/contracts/` -> `src/backend/ports/` -> `src/app/` -> leaf backends).
   No browser-specific globals, no direct cross-backend imports.
2. **Outside the Zig Runtime:** Applications select `DoeRuntime` through the
   package or native embedding. `DoeLab` supplies correction workflows and
   `DoeProof` evaluates execution. Fawn is an optional distribution integration.
3. **Cross-Layer Optimization:** Governed through explicit contracts
   (`WorkloadProfile`, `SpecializationPolicy`, `PromotionReceipt`), never
   through hidden runtime heuristics or implicit environment checks.

## Product boundary rules

The important boundary distinctions are:

- `runtime/zig` is the real runtime implementation
- `runtime/bridge/onnxruntime-ep` is a repo-only integration seam for a future Doe-backed ONNX Runtime plugin EP
- `doe-gpu` is the package surface over that runtime
- `doe-gpu/browser` is a browser wrapper, not the Doe runtime running inside the browser
- `browser/chromium` owns the experimental Fawn browser-runtime integration
- `bench` measures surfaces; it is not itself a product surface

Current scope:

- Dawn is the comparison baseline
- Doe runs in Node.js, Bun, Deno, drop-in, and embedded/native lanes
- a Doe-backed ONNX Runtime plugin EP is a repo-only experimental integration seam
- browser `navigator.gpu` replacement is an optional independently gated distribution lane

That separation is deliberate. It keeps package ergonomics, runtime behavior,
and browser integration from getting blurred together in docs or benchmarks.

## Core module flow

At a high level, Doe works like this:

1. `pipeline/upstream_intelligence` and `pipeline/agent`
   Preserve versioned Gerrit and issue evidence, produce constrained review
   packets, and independently mine checked-out source for quirk/workaround
   signals.
2. `config`
   Holds schemas, policies, workload contracts, and versioned control data.
3. `pipeline/lean`
   Formalizes selected obligations and emits proof artifacts when enabled.
4. `runtime/zig`
   Consumes config and optional proof artifacts, then executes the runtime on
   Metal, Vulkan, or D3D12.
5. `bench` and `pipeline/trace`
   Verify correctness, comparability, replayability, and claimability from
   emitted artifacts.

The current Lean theorem inventory is recorded in
`pipeline/lean/artifacts/proven-conditions.json`; architecture docs should
refer to that artifact rather than restating counts.

## Execution model

Command ingestion takes stable identity and canonical names from
`contracts/command.zig`. Parsing and payload cleanup switch exhaustively over
that contract. Compile-time alias checks reject missing owners and ambiguous
spellings; allocation and lifetime tests remain independent evidence. The
native WebGPU object API retains its own narrow adapters.

The [source-layout manifest](../runtime/zig/source-layout.json) owns module
responsibilities and dependency permissions; its [generated source map](../runtime/zig/src/README.md)
is the navigation surface. The [proposed user journeys](thesis.md#proposed-user-journeys)
exercise these owners rather than defining separate product subsystems. An
image-processing integration supplies shaders, declared work, and acceptance
tests; image-editor policy does not belong in resource management.

The optional `doe-gpu/compute-program` contract binds inline WGSL, fixed buffer
sizes and roles, ordered dispatches, and a readback output. Preparation retains
private allocations, shaders, pipelines, and bindings. Explicit `gpu-recorded`
execution owns compiled Vulkan commands and their pipeline and descriptor
lifetimes. `native-recorded` retains host commands and replays them through Zig;
`webgpu` retains resources and encodes each invocation as an explicit control.
GPU recordings validate native buffer identities before submission and own
private descriptor state. A device-local registry shares live Vulkan compute
pipelines after checking SPIR-V, entry point, descriptor layout, and effective
subgroup requirements. References outlive ordinary cache replacement and release
the pipeline when the last state closes.

Invocation-local buffers use input snapshots and scratch/output clears.
Explicit program-lifetime buffers retain state between invocations.
An atomic update shares only resources with identical declaration keys, records
the replacement plan, and closes the old program after successful preparation.
Source, shape, resource changes, and device loss therefore cannot silently reuse
stale command assumptions. See [`reusable-compute-programs.md`](reusable-compute-programs.md).

Keep immutable program descriptions, device-specific prepared resources, and
mutable invocation state distinct. A borrowed `PreparedOperation` is valid only
within its synchronous execution and callback scope. Deferred use owns an
`OwnedPreparedOperation` snapshot. CPU scope exit cannot establish GPU
completion: command recording, submission, completion, and final resource
release must each preserve the owner's lifetime obligations. Updates prepare
replacement state before publishing it, and failure preserves the old owner.
Snapshot cloning preserves slice alignment and sentinels and rejects typed data
pointers without an ownership rule. Opaque handles and callback addresses remain
externally owned identities; copying them does not extend a resource lifetime.
The registered snapshot tests cover source-owner release and partial-allocation
rollback. This is structural coverage and lifetime testing, not general ownership
proof or protection against copying an owning Zig struct.

Compatibility adapters translate host values, C layouts, callbacks, and errors
at explicit interfaces. They consume native ownership rules and expose the
cost and lifetime of host copies. Compiler transformations preserve source
locations and operation identity; diagnostics belong to the compilation that
produced them. Neither evidence collection nor workaround selection may become
a competing execution implementation.

The native compatibility work-done registry owns pending callback records
process-wide. Registration, future identity, and batch transfer are serialized;
event processing owns its transferred batch and invokes foreign callbacks after
unlocking. Reentrant registration therefore cannot overwrite pending delivery.
Callback userdata remains caller-owned through delivery. This registry does not
provide instance-local event routing or establish asynchronous GPU completion.

Resolve build configuration, device discovery, and invocation-dependent checks
at their respective lifetimes. Toggle classifications are compiled from the
versioned registry into immutable storage; physical GPU and driver matching
remain runtime inputs. Device allocators, queues, caches, and resource identities
retain device ownership. Future bounded scheduling belongs above those devices,
with explicit transfers. Browser and application-engine adapters supply host
requirements without adding browser or widget policy to shared GPU contracts.

The [command-storage example](command-storage-development.md) connects a typed
build policy to the existing pool and derived diagnostic metadata. Observation
stays in native ownership paths; calibration and candidate decisions stay in
benchmark tooling. This does not unify the native object API with the separate
prepared-operation executor or impose an evaluator on runtime users.

The active journeys reuse the existing package qualification, declared-program
applications, and compiler regressions. Their accepted behavior, physical
support, failure cases, and measurements stay with those executable workloads.
Pure-logic and allocation-failure tests complement retained-binary tests across
mapping, callbacks, submission, cancellation, and cleanup. Structural changes
preserve behavior; arithmetic or synchronization changes require separately
identified acceptance evidence.

Doe is designed around explicit runtime behavior:

- backend selection is policy/config driven
- strict lanes do not silently fallback
- unsupported capabilities fail with typed, actionable errors
- hot-path behavior stays in Zig unless it can be hoisted out by proof/config

Current native backend identities are:

- `doe_metal`
- `doe_vulkan`
- `doe_d3d12`
- `dawn_delegate` as the Dawn-comparison lane

## Verification boundary

Doe supports two broad modes:

1. Ahead-of-time verified execution
   Selected invariants are proven offline and used to remove runtime work.
2. Runtime-checked execution
   Zig keeps the necessary dynamic checks for untrusted inputs.

The design rule is:

1. implement deterministic behavior in Zig first
2. measure it
3. move conditions into proof/config only when that lets Doe delete runtime
   branches safely

## Browser lane split

There are two distinct browser-related paths:

1. `packages/doe-gpu/browser`
   A JS shim that forwards to the browser's own WebGPU objects. No Doe Zig
   runtime executes there.
2. `browser/chromium`
   The Track A lane that aims to make browser `navigator.gpu` run on Doe
   instead of Dawn.

Those paths answer different questions and should not be described as the same
thing.

They also sit at different maturity levels. The browser shim is a present
compatibility surface. The Fawn/Chromium lane is an active integration and
release target against the Dawn-based runtime browsers ship today, but it
remains diagnostic until a complete archive passes isolated clean install,
forced-provider identity, an unchanged application oracle, and lifecycle gates.

## Build and evidence outputs

A useful Doe build/run can emit:

- runtime artifact(s)
- run metadata
- trace or trace-meta artifacts
- a self-checking source-to-IR-to-backend execution identity receipt
- benchmark reports
- optional proof artifacts and hashes

The artifact chain matters as much as the code. Doe treats claims as valid only
when they are tied back to those emitted contracts.

Native package release candidates use a self-contained custody boundary. The
candidate report, its runtime-specific reliability report, and the exact
wrapper and platform tarballs share one bundle directory. Tracked
implementation references resolve against the declared clean Git commit;
shipped manifests, first-kernel entrypoints, addons, build metadata, and native
library hashes resolve from the retained tarballs. `bench` independently joins
the three Node, Bun, and Electron receipts before package-candidate admission.
Schema-version-1 reports that bind hashes without retaining the bytes remain
diagnostic history and cannot cross this boundary.

For native Vulkan, the execution-identity receipt composes the runtime's shader
artifact manifest with trace metadata and the workload oracle. It verifies the
exact WGSL, semantic state, IR, SPIR-V bytes, manifest identity, backend lane,
no-fallback state, dispatch count, and output digest. This is stronger than the
public JavaScript observer because it reaches the runtime-owned lowering
artifact; it remains narrower than driver- or operating-system-level tracing.

Package applications can opt into a separate native Vulkan identity journal
with `DOE_PROGRAM_IDENTITY_TRACE_PATH`. The public observer records the
application-visible source, command shape, synchronization, readback, and
output. The native journal independently binds exact WGSL and SPIR-V digests to
encoded compute dispatches and direct render draws. Compute completion is bound
to a later outer queue-submission row. Direct Vulkan render completion is bound
to `internal_submit_and_wait_succeeded`, emitted only after the render backend's
own submit-and-wait returns. A reviewed gate must join those layers explicitly;
neither layer is treated as proof of the other, and the journal is not a driver
trace or an output oracle.
