## 2026-04-25 (cycle 20) — Live HostPlan kv_read now sourced from TSIR (fourth ownership transfer; kv_cache file fully migrated)

Item 2 cycle-20 slice. Symmetric counterpart to cycle 19's
`emitWrite` swap. The hand-written body of
`emit_csl_kv_cache.emitRead` is gone. Same recipe: extract
WGSL-derived storage names from `module` + `info`, build a TSIR
SemanticFunction with bindings named to match those exact
symbols, delegate through `emitWithConfig` with `var_prefix=""`.

The `kv_read` body has no state buffer (no `decode_position`);
the read range is supplied by the host plan via `read_start` /
`read_len` params. TSIR's `emitCslKvRead` already declares those
params with the correct defaults (`read_start: i16 = 0;`,
`read_len: i16;`).

`emit_csl_kv_cache.zig` is now fully TSIR-driven on both halves
of the KV-cache lifecycle. The hand-maintained-emitter surface
in this module is empty.

Validation:

- `zig build test-wgsl`: 963 / 964 (same single pre-existing
  unrelated `reduction pattern` failure as cycles 9–19).
- `python3 bench/gates/schema_gate.py`: PASS.
- `python3 -m unittest discover -s bench/tests -p "test_csl*.py"`:
  77 passed.
- `python3 -m unittest discover -s bench/tests -p "test_doe_tsir*.py"`:
  22 passed.

Loop tally for live ownership transfers from hand-written
emitters to TSIR-driven CSL: **8 kernel bodies** (residual /
residual_prefill / residual_decode + gelu / gelu_prefill /
gelu_decode + kv_write + kv_read).

Hand-maintained surface remaining for Item 2: `emitRmsNormPe` in
`emit_csl_semantic_ops.zig` is the last entry. The TSIR
`rms_norm` body needs a Gemma `1+w` offset Config knob (or a
body-level flag) before swapping; the live hand-written body
emits `output[idx] = input[idx] * inv_rms * (1.0 + weight[idx])`,
where the `1.0 +` is the Gemma offset. TSIR's current emitter
uses the standard `inv_rms * scale[d]` form. Adding the offset
is a contained Config addition similar to `chunk_size_default`.

## 2026-04-25 (cycle 19) — Live HostPlan kv_write now sourced from TSIR (third ownership transfer)

Item 2 cycle-19 slice. Cycle 16's recipe applied to
`emit_csl_kv_cache.emitWrite`. The hand-written body — including
its `pe_id` / `num_pes` unused params, separate
`emitDecodePositionState` call, and module-driven storage-pointer
loop — is gone. The live wrapper extracts the WGSL-derived
storage-binding names from `module` + `info`, threads them into
a TSIR `SemanticFunction` (binding names `kp` / `vp` / `kc` /
`vc` from the WGSL globals plus the literal `position` for the
runtime state buffer), and asks TSIR to emit with no `tsir_` var
prefix.

The exported symbol contract is preserved:
`@export_symbol(<kp>_ptr, "<kp>")` etc. with the WGSL global
names, plus `@export_symbol(position_ptr, "position")` for the
decode-position state buffer. Internal var names differ from the
prior hand-written body (TSIR uses the binding name as the var
name; live used `decode_position` as a separate hardcoded var
name), but those are not part of the host plan binding contract.

This is the first ownership transfer outside
`emit_csl_semantic_ops.zig` — the `emit_csl_kv_cache.zig`
module's emitWrite is now a thin TSIR wrapper. `emitRead` remains
hand-maintained; symmetric swap is the natural next slice.

Validation:

- `zig build test-wgsl`: 963 / 964 (same single pre-existing
  unrelated `reduction pattern` failure as cycles 9–18).
- `python3 bench/gates/schema_gate.py`: PASS.
- `python3 -m unittest discover -s bench/tests -p "test_csl*.py"`:
  77 passed.
- `python3 -m unittest discover -s bench/tests -p "test_doe_tsir*.py"`:
  22 passed.

Note: the `kv_write` pattern is not in the gemma-3-1b HostPlan
target set so this swap doesn't affect that simulator regen.
Models that DO use kv_write (KV-cache attention variants outside
the gemma-3-1b fused-attention path) will get TSIR-driven CSL.

Loop tally for live ownership transfers from hand-written
emitters to TSIR-driven CSL: **7 kernel bodies** (residual /
residual_prefill / residual_decode + gelu / gelu_prefill /
gelu_decode + kv_write).

## 2026-04-25 (cycle 18) — cerebras-csl shard split (cycles 7–15 + late+16–21 → archive)

Item 6 cycle-18 slice. The live shard hit 1171 lines after cycle 17's
status entry — 29 line headroom against the 1200-line cap. Cycles 7
through 15 plus the earlier late+16 through late+21 history moved to
`archive/2026-04-25-loop-cycles-7-to-15.md` (968 lines). The live
shard now keeps cycles 16 + 17 inline (the live ownership-transfer
milestones) plus the steady-state sections.

Live shard: 1171 → 219 lines after this entry. Archive file: 968
lines.

This is the second split in this loop — the first happened in cycle
3 when the late+18 / late+19 entries pushed the shard over. The
archive file references in the live shard now form a chain:
`2026-04-25-loop-cycles-7-to-15.md` (this split) →
`2026-04-24.md` (cycle 3 split) → older monthly archives.

Validation: no code changes, no test runs needed.

## 2026-04-25 (cycle 17) — Live HostPlan gelu_gated now sourced from TSIR (second ownership transfer)

Item 2 cycle-17 slice. Cycle 16's recipe applied to
`emitGeluPe`. The hand-written gelu body is gone; `compile/gelu/`,
`compile/gelu_prefill/`, and `compile/gelu_decode/` pe_program.csl
files are now generated by TSIR's `emitCslGeluGated` path with
`var_prefix=""` and `chunk_size_default=1024`.

The TSIR `gelu_gated` body gained saturation clamping
(`if (inner < ±15.0) inner = ±15.0;`) to preserve the prior
hand-written numerical behavior. The live wrapper builds a
SemanticFunction with bindings named `gate` / `input` / `output`
(matching the live exports the host plan binding map expects).

Validation:

- `zig build test-wgsl`: 963 / 964 (same single pre-existing
  unrelated `reduction pattern` failure as cycles 9–16). The TSIR
  test for `gelu_gated` now also asserts on the clamping lines.
- `csl_sdk_driver.py simulator-plan.json`: **17 / 17 compile
  succeeded**, all 3 residual variants AND all 3 gelu variants
  succeed.
- Schema gate, CSL + TSIR Python tests: all green.

Loop tally for live ownership transfers from
`emit_csl_semantic_ops.zig` to TSIR-driven CSL: **6 kernel
bodies** (residual / residual_prefill / residual_decode +
gelu / gelu_prefill / gelu_decode). Remaining hand-maintained
in this file: `emitRmsNormPe` (TSIR `rms_norm` body needs a Gemma
`1+w` offset Config knob). And in `emit_csl_kv_cache.zig`:
`emitWrite` and `emitRead` (TSIR `kv_write`/`kv_read` ready).

## 2026-04-25 (cycle 16) — Live HostPlan residual_add now sourced from TSIR (first ownership transfer)

Item 2 cycle-16 slice. The hand-written body of
`emit_csl_semantic_ops.emitResidualPe` is gone. The live HostPlan
residual / residual_prefill / residual_decode pe_program.csl files
are now generated from a TSIR `SemanticFunction` with body op
`residual_add`, dispatched through
`tsir.emit_kernel_body.emitWithConfig(.., .csl, &.{ .var_prefix
= "", .chunk_size_default = 1024 })`. This is the first time a
production HostPlan kernel's CSL comes out of the TSIR contract
emitter rather than a hand-maintained per-kernel body in
`emit_csl_semantic_ops.zig`.

Landed:

- `runtime/zig/src/tsir/emit_kernel_body.zig`: `Config` extended
  with `chunk_size_default: ?u32 = null`. New helper
  `writeCslChunkSizeParam` emits either `param chunk_size: i16;`
  (default null preserves existing behavior) or `param chunk_size:
  i16 = <value>;` when set. Wired through `emitCslResidualAdd` and
  `emitCslGeluGated`.
- `runtime/zig/src/doe_wgsl/emit_csl_semantic_ops.zig`: added
  imports for `tsir/emit_kernel_body.zig` and `tsir/schema.zig`.
  `emitResidualPe`'s 30-line hand-written body replaced with a
  SemanticFunction construction (bindings `a` / `b` / `output`,
  body op `residual_add`) plus a TSIR delegation through an
  `ArrayList(u8)` writer (TSIR helpers' error set is
  Allocator.Error-shaped, so `FixedBufferStream`'s NoSpaceLeft
  doesn't fit). The live wrapper sets
  `chunk_size_default = 1024` to match the prior hand-written
  default — the elementwise layout doesn't forward `chunk_size`
  through `@set_tile_code`, so cslc raises
  `csl_compile_uninitialized_param` without it.

Why a default was needed: the live elementwise `layout.csl` only
forwards `.memcpy_params` to pe_program. Top-level
`--params=chunk_size:N` from the cslc command flows to the layout
module, where it's logged as "externally provided initializer:
chunk_size: unused entry in module instantiation" because the
layout doesn't declare `chunk_size`. The pe_program ran on its
hand-written `param chunk_size: i16 = 1024;` default. Mirroring
that default in the TSIR-emitted output is the minimal-change
swap that preserves cslc's compile path.

Validation evidence:

- `zig build test-wgsl`: 963 / 964 passed. Same single
  pre-existing `reduction pattern` test failure as cycles 9–15.
  The live `host compile source` test that asserts
  `output[idx] = a[idx] + b[idx];` substring on the residual
  pe_program continues to pass — the TSIR-emitted output produces
  this byte-equivalent line.
- `python3 bench/gates/schema_gate.py`: PASS.
- `python3 -m unittest discover -s bench/tests -p "test_csl*.py"`:
  77 passed.
- `python3 -m unittest discover -s bench/tests -p "test_doe_tsir*.py"`:
  22 passed.
- `python3 -m unittest discover -s bench/tests -p "test_int4ple*.py"`:
  40 passed.
- End-to-end: `csl_sdk_driver.py simulator-plan.json` against the
  regenerated artifacts compiles **17 / 17** targets. All three
  residual variants succeed:
    `residual succeeded`,
    `residual_prefill succeeded`,
    `residual_decode succeeded`.

Item 2 hand-maintained surface remaining in
`emit_csl_semantic_ops.zig`:

- `emitGeluPe` (TSIR has the `gelu_gated` body since cycle 10;
  same swap pattern as residual but with `gate` / `input` /
  `output` bindings).
- `emitRmsNormPe` (TSIR has `rms_norm` since the original Phase A
  surface; the live body has the Gemma `1+w` offset which the
  TSIR `rms_norm` body does not yet model — need a Config knob or
  a body-level flag before swapping).
- `emit_csl_kv_cache.emitWrite` and `emitRead` (TSIR has
  `kv_write` / `kv_read` since cycles 11–12; live binding map
  expects `kp` / `vp` / `kc` / `vc` symbol names which differ
  from TSIR's `key_projection` / `value_projection` /
  `key_cache` / `value_cache` — same `binding.name` parameterization
  works).

Each of these is now a tractable next-cycle slice using the same
recipe this cycle established.

## Current state

- The forward architecture for replacing classifier/template CSL lowering with
  parity-oracle-first TSIR lowering is documented in
  `docs/tsir-lowering-plan.md`. Phase A compiler surface is landed (schema,
  digests, frontend, planner, reference interpreter, and mechanical skeleton
  emitters for five backends including a TSIR-to-CSL skeleton; see
  [`docs/status/tsir.md`](./tsir.md)). The TSIR-to-CSL emitter has executable
  bodies for `fused_gemv`, `rms_norm`, `gather`, `residual_add`,
  `gelu_gated`, `kv_write`, and `kv_read`; the live CSL lane still routes
  through the classifier/template + `emit_csl_semantic_ops.zig` path for
  those kernels rather than through the TSIR emitter — the wiring switch is
  the open Item-2 work.
- The INT4 PLE CSL lane now applies manifest compile params to the live
  simulator plan and records the result at
  `hostPlanBundle.manifestCompileParamApplication`.
- The fresh simulator driver result on this host compiles **17 of 17**
  compile targets at manifest scale (embed, rmsnorm, rmsnorm_prefill,
  rmsnorm_decode, tiled, rope, attn_head256, residual, residual_prefill,
  residual_decode, gelu, gelu_prefill, gelu_decode, gemv, attn_decode,
  lm_head_gemv, sample). Source of truth:
  `bench/out/doppler-reference/gemma-3-1b-doe-csl-hostplan/trace.json.driver-result.json`.
- Runtime advances through `embed` (chunked dispatch, 6 sublaunches succeed
  in launch[0]) and `rmsnorm_prefill` (launch[1] succeeds end-to-end); was
  in `tiled` q_proj output memcpy_d2h when the 600s wallclock timeout hit.
  Source of truth:
  `bench/out/doppler-reference/gemma-3-1b-doe-csl-hostplan/simulator-evidence.json`.
- The blocker is no longer kernel architecture — the four kernels previously
  flagged (`embed`, `lm_head_gemv_stable`, `attn_head256`, `attn_head512`)
  all compile cleanly and at least `embed` runs cleanly under the BF16
  layernorm-broadcast fix landed late+18 / cycle 7. Open work is now the
  simulator wallclock vs simfabric per-launch cost, the TSIR-to-live-path
  wiring, and the parity-comparison data the simulator-evidence gate
  cannot yet produce.

## Active blockers

- Simulator wallclock: the 600s default
  `INT4PLE_RUNTIME_RUNNER` timeout drains in three launches (embed +
  rmsnorm_prefill + tiled-in-progress) for the gemma-3-1b regen. Either
  raise the timeout to a value matched to per-kernel simfabric cost, or
  audit embed's chunked-dispatch ROI (6 sublaunches × ~33 s each) before
  asking the simulator to traverse the full prefill + decode tail.
- TSIR live-path wiring: the live HostPlan still routes through
  `emit_csl_semantic_ops.zig` and `emit_csl_kv_cache.zig` for the seven
  ops the TSIR emitter now covers. Switching the live path through TSIR
  needs symbol-export reconciliation (live exports `a` / `b` vs TSIR
  `summand_a` / `summand_b`, etc.) and bootstrap fixtures the
  `tsir-real-entries` directory does not yet carry for these ops.
- Numeric parity: the `csl_simulator_evidence_gate` reports
  `numericParity.status = unknown` because no Doppler reference logits /
  KV digests are wired into the comparison path. Until that source is
  attached, plumbing-pass is the strongest signal the gate can emit.
- Stale doc assertion: the `reduction pattern` test in
  `runtime/zig/src/doe_wgsl/emit_csl_host_compile_source.zig` asserts
  `i < hidden_size` and `@range(u32, 64)` — both belong to the old
  WGSL-derived reduction lowering. The semantic-emitter rmsnorm replaces
  the loop with `for (@range(i16, hidden_size))` and inlines the Gemma
  `1+w` offset directly. The test fails in `zig build test-wgsl` and is
  unrelated to any active code change in this loop.

## Landed infrastructure

- Shared execution contract wiring between Doppler source artifacts, HostPlan,
  transcript receipts, and parity receipts.
- Manifest compile-param projection and apply path for the live transcript
  producer.
- HostPlan executor validator, execution-plan receipt, target-session probe,
  and bootstrap/runtime scaffolding.
- Fail-closed promotion gates for manifest compile params and transcript
  readiness.

## Ground truth

- SDK access is no longer the primary blocker on this host.
- `cslc` runs and produces real linker/compiler diagnostics.
- The missing work is bounded to kernel redesign plus the downstream transcript
  executor path that consumes those kernels.

## Use this shard for

- Cerebras SDK / CSL runtime status
- INT4 PLE compile/runtime blockers
- HostPlan executor status
- Simulator and hardware promotion status
